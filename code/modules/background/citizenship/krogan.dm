	description = "After their defeat in the Rebellions, the very concept of krogan leadership was discredited. \
	Where a warlord could once command enough power to bring entire solar systems to heel and become Overlord, \
	these days it is rare for a single leader to have more than a thousand warriors swear allegiance to him. \
	It is speculated that their instinctive aggression and territorial nature prevent the krogan from forming any \
	kind of centralized government or parliament that is not based on fear or obedience. The krogan homeworld of \
	Tuchanka is divided into multiple nation-states, including the Republic of Ghurst, which was embroiled in a rebellion in 2185."
