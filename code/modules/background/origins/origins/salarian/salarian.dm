	desc = "Salarians excel at invention, preferring to use cutting-edge technology rather than settle for anything less. \
	For example, their GARDIAN starship defenses put emphasis on high performance over reliability even though a malfunction \
	could cost lives. Even Schells rejected a cheating device that used 'brute force,' spending five years to refine it into a \
	more sophisticated, undetectable system. Normally, the rare salarian females are cloistered on their worlds out of tradition and \
	respect. Powerful female Dalatrasses are dynasts and political kingpins. They determine the political course of their respective \
	regions through shrewd negotiation. Though male salarians rise to positions of great authority in business, academia, or the military, \
	they rarely have any input on politics; one notable exception to this rule is Valern, a male salarian representing his race on the Citadel Council in 2183."

	uncomfortable to live in and dangerous to the unwary. The technophilic salarians had significant pollution and \
	waste problems early in the development of their society. They also embraced social solutions just as quickly, and \
	through complex breeding rules, Sur'Kesh now maintains a crowded but sustainable population. The planet tends to be \
	wetter than Earth, and salarian cities spare no expense to collect and provide fresh water, as one might expect \
	from an amphibious species."

	desc = "Erinle is a garden world in its last stages of habitability. While its soil still supports agriculture, its animal biodiversity has fallen to record lows, and the most \
	successful remaining life is toxic blue-green algae and insect-like pest species. A large salarian colony is trying to restore biodiversity to the planet, but setbacks are a \
	fact of life. Mineral and fuel mining remains lucrative, however, and Erinle has a thriving spaceport that refuels many ships passing into the Terminus Systems."

	desc = "Spacer investors are fond of saying: 'You can't exhaust a gas giant.' But the salarians have certainly tried. Halegeuse is home to a thriving community of robo-miners \
	and those who work in helium-3 collection and refinement. More than 16 of Halegeuse's more metallic moons have been settled. The giant bears the name of the Halegeuse \
	Corporation, which combined the best efforts of several salarian clans to manufacture the advanced shielding necessary to colonize the planet's moons. The planet's magnetosphere \
	retains massive amounts of radioactive ions from Pranas, the system's star. Because of this, the cities on the moons are subsurface, protected from lethal radiation \
	levels by shielding and thick layers of rock. Halegeuse was bought out centuries ago, but the name endures as a symbol of salarian innovation and cooperation."

	and far between. Not much is written about Dagnes, but a recent box office hit, 'The Demon and the Nighmare', tells the story of the colony almost being wiped out by two named \
	Thresher Maws. Today, the colony barely survives, as it always has."

	Union, harboring many illegal trades right under the nose of its planetary government. In recent times, Asari SPECTRE Tela Vasir was credited for dissolving a large batarian \

	poor, working-class humans, which have lately reached a boiling point in the Olor Water Riots. The company primarily charged with water distribution, the salarian company \
	AquaStructure, has continuously declined to comment on its refusal to build water pipes in the human district of Xi Hu."
