	description = "Turians believe that groups and areas have 'spirits' that transcend the individual. \
	For example, a military unit would be considered to have a literal spirit that embodies the honor and \
	courage it has displayed. A city's spirit reflects the accomplishments and industry of its residents. \
	An ancient tree's spirit reflects the beauty and tranquility of the area it grows within."
