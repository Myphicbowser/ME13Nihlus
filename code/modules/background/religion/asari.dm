	description = "The pantheistic mainstream asari religion is siari, which translates roughly as 'All is one'. \
	The faithful agree on certain core truths: the universe is a consciousness, every life within it is an aspect of \
	the greater whole, and death is a merging of one's spiritual energy back into greater universal consciousness. \
	Siarists don't specifically believe in reincarnation; they believe in spiritual energy returning to the universal \
	consciousness upon death will eventually be used to fill new mortal vessels."
