	description = "While modern Salarians are not notably religious, in ancient times \
	some salarians practiced a religion that featured the so-called 'stones of life'; Mosiiba, \
	Mosiino and Mosiives. Some faiths survive however; one of the less favored salarian religions \
	(which the Council deems a 'cult') worships a goddess, and claims that a certain pattern of overlapping \
	craters in the southern hemisphere of Trelyn resembles her. Liara T'Soni comments that many salarians \
	believe in a wheel of life, which some Salarians liken to Hinduism due to a shared belief in reincarnation."
