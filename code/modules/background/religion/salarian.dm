	name = RELIGION_TRANSMIGRATIONISM
	description = "Transmigrationism is, simply, the belief in reincarnation without extraneous religious trappings. Many Salarians hold this belief, and believe that the process of reincarnation is entirely random, \
	instead of being reincarnated as specific lifeforms due to consequence of actions in the previous life."
